<h2>A Bit about me:</h2><br>
                🔭 I'm a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong><br>
<!--                 ⚡ I am also Github's <strong><em>"Arctic Code Vault Contributor"</em></strong>.<br> -->
                ⚛️ I’m currently onto <strong>"Full-Stack Web-Development"</strong> using the <strong>MEAN</strong><em> stack(Mongodb, ExpressJs, Angular, NodeJs)</em> and <em>Spring Boot and Microservices</em>.<br>
                😄 Apart from these, I am an aspiring <em>"Data-Structures and Algorithms"</em> learner using Java and have handy knowledge on version-control GIT.<br><br>
                <!--👯 Coding has changed my perception of the world. It's not just about Apps. Learning to code provided me with the <i>problem-solving skills</i> and ways to communicate with others on a more technical level.<br><br> -->
